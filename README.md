This is the code for the Demo App I made for the Journal Of Econ at CWRU 

## About the Code

This Application is coded in the programming language Dart, and used the Flutter SDK package to help it run. The advantage of this method of creating the app is that it helps the Application have an identical user interaction regardless of whether they use an Android or IOS device.
